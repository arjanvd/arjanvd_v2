OBJECTS

===============================================================================
03_objects/_objects.scss
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From https://zellwk.com/blog/css-architecture-2/:

Objects (.o-) are the smallest building blocks of a website. Consider them to 
be Lego blocks where you can copy-paste anywhere in your website. Objects have 
the following properties:
[a] Objects uses the .o- prefix
[b] They cannot contain other objects or components.
[c] They are context independent.

Additions:
[a] Example: .o-object
[b] Objects can be small or large. The number of HTML elements within the 
    object isn’t relevant. All inner elements can only exist within the 
    specific object.
[c] Objects are context independent. They don’t know where they’re used. You 
    could pick any object up, throw it somewhere else and it won’t break the
    structure of your site. This also means objects should not change any 
    structure outside itself.
